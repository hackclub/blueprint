##### FAQ

## When does this program end?

Currently, the end-date of Blueprint is January 1st. You’ll still have time after that to build & earn tickets.

## How can I earn tickets?

Project grants are awarded on quality rather than hours spent. However, if you track your time building your project after getting your grant (or all the time if you don't need a grant), you will be awarded with tickets which can be redeemed at the [toolbag](/toolbag). If your project doesn't have a lot of in-person build time, you will have fewer tickets awarded. One way to get more tickets for example is to get PCB + Components and hand-solder rather than just getting PCBA.

Tickets are rewarded based on the effort you spent BUILDING your project, not the time spent DESIGNING it!

## How many projects can I make?

As many as you like! We just ask that you only do one of each starter project.

## I don't have a soldering iron. How can I get one?

You can get one as a part of Hackpad!

## Can I make a Hackpad and a keyboard?

Yes! 

## What can I make

Anything within budget!

## Do I need the journal in my repo?

No! It just needs to be in [blueprint.hackclub.com](blueprint.hackclub.com) :D 

## How long may reviews take?

Reviews may vary in time! They can take a week or more. We try to review as soon as possible :) 

## How do I top-up my grant? 

If you need a topup for your approved project, use this topup form: https://forms.hackclub.com/blueprint-topup


## What tier is my project? What about X idea, or Y?

We can’t give you an estimate until you design out your project. You can have a really complex idea, but if it is not polished, it will be a lower tier. 

## Does my project need to have a PCB?

Not at all. Unless you’re going advanced, most projects don't need pcbs, and we encourage that you hand wire components!

## Does Blueprint allow group projects?

Yes! However, only one person can submit the project and access the journal.

## Can I get reimbursed for 3D Printed parts!

Yep! We will partially reimburse you to the nearest 250g of filament.

## Can I submit an existing project or one that I previously started?

If it's already finished, unfortunately not, sorry! Start a new project.
If you've just started/are in the middle of designing, you need to have journaled the entire process beforehand.

If you're almost done designing, unfortunately not.

## Can I double dip with Summer of Making or any other Hack Club program?

No! Double-dipping is not allowed. If you have coding time for your project, you can journal it, get tickets, and get prizes from the tool bag.

## How much money can I spend on my project

You can spend up to the budget based on your quality tier which is outlined in [custom projects](/docs). If you need over this amount, you can use your own money. [Also see this about Hack Club and cost.](/docs/about-cost)

## How will I get my 3D printed parts?

Through **printing legion!** It's an international network of Hack Clubbers 3D printing for each other! Check out [their website](https://printlegion.hackclub.com/)

## How likely is it that my project will be approved?

It's hard to say without seeing your project, but generally speaking, as long as you follow the [guidelines](/docs/submission-guidelines) on the submitting page for your project then you're more than likely to be approved!

## What's the minimum complexity for a custom project?

The minimum complexity for a project depends on tiers. Check out [custom projects](/docs/submission-guidelines) for more information on that. Additionally, every project **must** be [shipped](/docs/shipping).

## What if my project does not reach the quality requirement for my tier, can I pay for the difference myself?

Yes!

## How do I get a Blueprint-ed profile picture?

DM Kashsuks!

## Can I use AI

Yes for code, no for Journals

## I'm 18, would I still be eligible for a grant for my project through blueprint?

As long as you join Blueprint before you turn 19, you’re good! For Prototype, as long as you're still 18 by the end of the event, you're okay!

## Are hackatime-banned individuals allowed to participate?

Sorry, No!

## Can we use tools like Ergogen?

You're free to use it to experiment with layouts and make design decisions, but the actual placement of the footprints and schematic has to be done manually by you.

## Can I journal research?

Yes!

## Can people get tickets after January first?

Yes! The submission is due January 1st, but there's going to be time after to build & spend tickets.

## Can I use auto-routing software?

No. You must do your routing manually. 

## How can I contribute? 

PRs are accepted and appreciated! If you are willing to use rails, do cool art, or make cool and useful hardware guides, DM @CAN on Slack! We appreciate all help :)
