# Submission guidelines! 

Here's everything you need to know to get your project approved!

The goal of Blueprint is to get you, yes *you* creating **shipped** projects. It is the *only* thing we check for - we try not to have any unnecessary / arbitrary requirements.

**Shipping your project is the process of making it usable & understanding for other people.** It means that someone should be able to look at your README.md file and know *exactly* what they need to do to build & use your project from scratch.

This is really important! It makes sure that your project is actually real and exists in the world, and not just as a file on your computer.

*A good read on this can be found here: [what is shipping?](/resources/shipping)*

**The following is a list of hard requirements from us, missing any of these will automatically get your project returned**

Keep in mind that these are a *minimum*, and you're encouraged to go above and beyond! Add a 3D render, custom logo, and more - you might just get something special :)

- [x] the source files for your PCB, if you have one (.kicad\_pro, .kicad\_sch, gerbers.zip, etc)
- [x] **A .STEP file of your project's 3D CAD model as well as the source design file format as well - .f3d, .FCStd, etc; for OnShape, add a public link to your README)**
- [x] ANY other files that are part of your project (firmware, libraries, references, etc)
- [x] You have everything easily readable and organized into folders.

*if you're missing a .STEP file with all of your electronics and CAD, your project will not be approved*

##### YOU *DO NOT* HAVE:
- [ ] **AI Generated READMEs, Journal entries, or an image of your project**
- [ ] Taken designs from other people

Any project that includes stolen content, fully AI-generated design files, or other fraudulent/dishonest material may be permanently rejected and could result in a ban from Blueprint and other Hack Club programs!

#### Examples

Here are some examples of well-shipped projects made by Hack Clubbers! They're seriously awesome

- [NotARoomba's Cyberboard](https://github.com/notaroomba/cyberboard)
- [Brandon's USB-Mic](https://github.com/ConfusedHello/USB-Mic/?tab=readme-ov-file)
