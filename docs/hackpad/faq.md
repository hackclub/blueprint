# Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome to the FAQ section! If you have something you think should be added here please ping @alexren in the #blueprint channel!

**What gets shipped to me?**
- A kit of all the electronic components for your macropad!
- a $15 HCB Card grant to get your **PCB** made from JLCPCB, and to get a case 3D printed from #printing-legion if needed

**When is the deadline?** \
Same deadline as Blueprint! March 31st, 2026

**Where can I find KiCAD footprints / what's the measurement for this thing / etc** \
A lot of these questions can be answered by checking out the [resources and tips section](/hackpad/resources)! You can find **KiCAD footprints**, 3D models, etc

**Can I use a microcontroller other than the XIAO RP2040?** \
Sorry, no! If you want to use something else, you can enable "expert mode" in Blueprint and build a custom project instead!

The XIAO is a great primer and I recommend using it, but it's totally understandable if you want to do something more advanced! We won't stop you :)

**Will my hackpad come assembled?** \
Unfortunately not! Not to fear though - assembling a macropad isn't that hard!

**Can I use acrylic/cnc metal/etc for the case/plate?** \
NO!!! Only 3D prints are supported.

**Can I use parts outside of the approved list?** \
Yes! You are responsible for sourcing it on your own money though

**What colours are the keycaps?** \
White!

**Can I use Choc switches?** \
No!

**What are the footprint name for through hole diodes?** \
The footprint for 1N4148 Diodes are D_DO-35_SOD27_P7.62mm_Horizontal.

**Where will everything be shipped from?** \
It'll be shipped from HQ, which is located in Shelburne VT.
