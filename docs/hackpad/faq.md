# Frequently Asked Questions!

Hey there! This page is meant to try to answer any questions you may have about Hackpad! 

If you have a question that isn't covered here, feel free to ask in #blueprint! You can ping me @alexren directly as well if you're really stuck.

**What is hackpad?**
Hackpad is an event under Blueprint where you can learn step-by-step how to design your own macropad from scratch! After designing, you can submit it to get the parts needed to build it!

You can find the requirements in the [submitting](/hackpad/submitting) page.

**What gets sent to me?**
After being approved, you'll recieve the following:
- a kit of all the electronic components, sent from Hack Club HQ.
- a $20 card grant to get your circuit board made by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com), as well as to buy a soldering iron if you need to
- 50% progress to Prototype! A hardware hackathon in San Jose from Dec 19 to 21. *For US residents only*

**How do I get my case 3D printed?**
Through [Printing Legion!](https://printlegion.hackclub.com) It's an international network of other teenagers from Hack Club who have 3D printers! Use the card grant sent to you to pay for the shipping label

**What's in the kit?**
All the parts for your hackpad! More specifically:

- 1x [SEEED XIAO RP2040](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040/) - this is the microcontroller!
- 1x [0.91 inch OLED](https://www.pishop.ca/product/0-91-inch-white-oled-display-module-i2c-interface/) display (NOTE THE PINOUT!)

- 16x [Gateron Milky Yellow](https://beaverkeys.ca/products/gateron-milky-yellow-pro) keyswitches!
- 16x [White DSA blank](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4998) Keycaps!
- 16x [1N4148](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C258182.html) Diodes

- 4x [M3x5x4mm heatset inserts](https://vector3d.shop/products/heat-set-insert-m3-voron) - these melt into your 3D printed case

Each part has a reference link so you know what you're working with! 

**When is the deadline?**
January 1st to submit your design!

**Can I use parts outside of the kit?**
Yes, but you are responsible for sourcing them with your own money - I would recommend sticking to the kit contents
