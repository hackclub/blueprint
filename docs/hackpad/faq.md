# Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome to the FAQ section! If you have something you think should be added here please ping @alexren in the #hackpad channel

**What gets shipped to me?**
- A kit of all the parts in the [Kit Contents page](/hackpad/parts)!
- a $15 HCB Card grant to get your **PCB** made, and a case 3D printed from [printing legion](https://www.printlegion.hackclu.com/) if needed!
- a $18 HCB Card grant to get your soldering iron, if you need one. This is non-transferrable.

**What is an HCB Card grant??**

[READ ME](/hackpad/cardgrant) FOR INFO

**Where can I find KiCAD footprints / what's the measurement for this thing / etc**

A lot of these questions can be answered by checking out the [resources and tips section](/hackpad/resources)! You can find **KiCAD footprints**, 3D models, etc

**Can I use a microcontroller other than the XIAO RP2040?**

Unfortunately not for hackpad! If you want to use a custom microcontroller, you'll have to submit it as a custom project to Blueprint.

The XIAO is a great primer and I recommend using it, but it's totally understandable if you want to do something more advanced! We won't stop you :)

**Will my hackpad come assembled?**

Unfortunately not! Not to fear though - assembling a macropad is a great learning experience!

**Can I use acrylic/cnc metal/etc for the case/plate?**

NO! Only 3D prints are supported.

**Can I use parts outside of the approved list?**

Yes! You are responsible for sourcing it on your own money though.

**Where will everything be shipped from?**

It'll be shipped from [Hack Club HQ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EPwC2izABPnbVgjq9), which is located in Shelburne, Vermont USA.

**I have more questions!!!**
