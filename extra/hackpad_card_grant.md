# HCB Card Grant Info

Hey there! This email contains the $15 virtual credit card grant you recieve as part of your hackpad

It is used to buy two things:

1. Your PCB, from JLCPCB (<$5 USD)
2. If needed, a shipping label for your 3D printed parts! which will be printed by another teenager through #printing-legion (<$10 USD)

If you have access to a 3D printer, you can ignore #2.

Here's a quick explainer on how to use it!

## Ordering your PCB:

## Getting your 3D printed case
If you don't have access to a 3D printer, you can use [Printing Legion!](printlegion.hackclub.com) - it's an international network of other Hack Clubbers who can help you get your printed parts! Check it out - this grant is to pay for the shipping label, it should be under $10

DO NOT USE EXTERNAL 3D PRINTING SERVICES.


## Rules/Other important info:
- **DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER PARTS OTHER THAN YOUR PCB. THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THE KIT THAT WILL BE SHIPPED FROM HACK CLUB HQ.**
- After purchasing, make sure to upload the receipts for it! This helps us keep our nonprofit status
- Do not, under any circumstance, use this card to unlock free trials for anything - it risks Hack Club as an org being shut down. 

## After buying

Once you have purchased everything you need, please return the card! The excess money comes back to us 

If you run into ANY issues, please ask in #blueprint!
