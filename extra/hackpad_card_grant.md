# HCB Card Grant Info

Hey there! This email contains the $15 virtual credit card grant you recieve as part of your hackpad

It is used to buy two things:

1. Your PCB, from JLCPCB (<$5 USD)
2. If needed, a shipping label for your 3D printed parts! which will be printed by another teenager through #printing-legion (<$10 USD)

If you have access to a 3D printer, you can ignore #2.

Here's a quick explainer on how to use it!

## Ordering your PCB:
Order from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)! The PCB itself should be roughly $2, and the shipping should be under $5 USD - make sure that the shipping option selected is "Global Standard Direct", not UPS/FedEx/DHL etc. 

## Getting your 3D printed case
If you don't have access to a 3D printer, you can use [Printing Legion!](printlegion.hackclub.com) - it's an international network of other Hack Clubbers who can help you get your printed parts! Check it out - this grant is to pay for the shipping label, it should be under $10

DO NOT USE EXTERNAL 3D PRINTING SERVICES.

## Getting your other components
THIS WILL BE IN THE KIT SHIPPED FROM HACK CLUB HQ. DO NOT BUY THE OTHER COMPONENTS.

## Rules/Other important info:
- After purchasing, make sure to upload the receipts for it! This helps us keep our nonprofit status
- Do not, under any circumstance, use this card to unlock free trials for anything - it risks Hack Club as an org being shut down. 
- **DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER PARTS OTHER THAN YOUR PCB. THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THE KIT THAT WILL BE SHIPPED FROM HACK CLUB HQ.**

## After spending / leftover money

Once you have purchased everything you need, please return the card! The excess money comes back to us and helps us keep these programs sustainable

If you run into ANY issues, please ask in #blueprint!
